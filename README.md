# Random-Forest
Random Forest Algorithm:

Logic: Random forest constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Description: It uses bootstrapping and feature randomness to create diverse trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Practical Examples:
Eg 1: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on their past purchase history and demographics.
Eg 2: Building a robust model to predict customer lifetime value using a variety of features such as purchase history, demographics, and online behavior.

In the code mentioned, we use the Random-forest algorithm to predict the digit images from sk-learn library
