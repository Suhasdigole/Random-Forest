# Random-Forest
Random Forest Algorithm:

Logic: Random forest constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Description: It uses bootstrapping and feature randomness to create diverse trees, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
